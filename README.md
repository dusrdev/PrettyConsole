* ðŸ’¾ Supports legacy ansi terminals (like Windows 7)
* âœ‚ Trimming friendly (documented trim warnings and working alternatives for everything)

## Usage

The most convinient way to use this package is to add this using statement: `using static PrettyConsole.Console;`  
Than use most of the default method signatures such as `Write`, `WriteLine`, `ReadLine` and so on, conviniently they are named exactly the same as the regular c# versions.  
For more information about these methods and the platora of additinal ones, check the [Wiki](https://github.com/dusrdev/PrettyConsole/wiki).
