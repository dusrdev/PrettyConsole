# PrettyConsole

An abstraction over `System.Console` that adds new input and output methods, colors and advanced outputs like progress bars and menus. And everything is ansi supported so it works on legacy systems and terminals.

## Features

* ðŸš€ High performance, Low memory usage and allocation
* ðŸª¶ Very lightweight (No external dependencies)
* Easy to use (no need to learn a new syntax while still writing less boilerplate code)
* ðŸ”Œ Plug and play (most of the time you don't need to change your code much)
* ðŸ’¾ Supports legacy ansi terminals (like Windows 7)
* âœ‚ Trimming friendly (documented trim warnings and working alternatives for everything)
* Supports all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)
* ðŸ˜Ž Beautifully uniform out of the box (Default colors that can be customized)
* â›“ Uses original output pipes, so that your cli's can be piped properly.

## â¬‡ Installation

To keep build pipelines simple, since version 1.5.2, the new packages will only be available in **Nuget**.

* Nuget   [![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/PrettyConsole?label=Downloads)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PrettyConsole/)

## Usage

The most convenient way to use this package is to add this using statement: `using static PrettyConsole.Console;`  
Then use most of the default method signatures such as `Write`, `WriteLine`, `ReadLine` and so on, conveniently they are named exactly the same as the regular C# counterparts.

For more information about these methods and additional ones, check the [Wiki](https://github.com/dusrdev/PrettyConsole/wiki).
