## Default abstractions (Trim friendly)

```csharp
public static string ReadLine(string message);
```

## Generic abstraction 1 - Uses reflection and will be trimmed

```csharp
public static T? ReadLine<T>(string message);
```

## Generic abstraction 2 - infers the type from `type` and could be safe from trimming

```csharp
public static T? ReadLine<T>(string message, Type type);
```

To use this is much easier than the default from `System.Console`, all you need is to specify the type of input and provide a message (there will be a single space between the message and input by default). and the method will convert to your desired type by itself and also throw an appropriate exception if it should occur.

Example:

```csharp
int num = ReadLine<int>("Enter number:");
```

* The overloads above will use the `Colors.Input` color for the input, if you want to customize a specific one, there is an overload which takes a `ConsoleColor` for the input.

## Request any input

```csharp
public static void RequestAnyInput(string message = "Press any key to continue");
```

this is similar to how you would use `ReadKey()` from `System.Console`. it will show the message and wait for the user to break by pressing **Enter**.

## Confirm

```csharp
public static bool Confirm(string message);
```

This is used to confirm a boolean choice from the user, such as "Save output"... it will handle the input with the message.  
inputs such as "y", "yes" or line break (pressing Enter) will be parsed as `true`.  
all the rest will be regarded as `false`.

* This input method ignores case.
