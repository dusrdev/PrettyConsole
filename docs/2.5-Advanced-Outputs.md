## Labels

Labels are outputs similar to `Write` but offer the option to configure background color as well.
* Being similar to `Write`, `Label` doesn't end the line, to end the line after, call `NewLine`.

```csharp
public static void Label(string? output);
```

Calling a `Label` without extra color parameters will display `ConsoleColor.Black` text over `Colors.Default` background.

```csharp
public static void Label(string? output, ConsoleColor foreground, ConsoleColor background);
```

Use exactly like `Write`, but configure both colors.

## Multi-color output

```csharp
public static void Label(params (string output, ConsoleColor foreground, ConsoleColor background)[] elements);
```

Same as before, configure like `Write`.
