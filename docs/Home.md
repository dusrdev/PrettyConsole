# Welcome to the PrettyConsole Wiki

The most convenient way to use this package is to add this using statement: `using static PrettyConsole.Console;`
Then use most of the default method signatures such as `Write`, `WriteLine`, `ReadLine` and so on, conveniently they are named exactly the same as the regular C# counterparts.

In the next pages you can find detailed information about all the options.
