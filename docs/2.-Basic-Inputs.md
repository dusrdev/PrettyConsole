# Basic Inputs

The main methods for input are `ReadLine` and `ReadLine<T>`, to reduce the amount of code need to be written, those method directly accept `ColoredOutput`.

Some of the overloads also allow customization of the input color, and the generic overloads are supported for all types that implement `IParsable<T>` which are most of the basic types in C#, as this is an interface, you can also implement it in your own types and that will make them supported as well.
There is are also overloads for `TEnum` which enable parsing `enum`s, and they also provide an option to `ignoreCase`.

Using `ReadLine` is the most comparable way to `System.Console`, however, all of the variants also have a corresponding `TryReadLine` which both will return whether the type was even able to be parsed, and by using an `out` parameter, enable better type inference from the compiler, which may result in smaller, more readable code.

## Input Requests

```csharp
RequestAnyInput(string message = "Press any key to continue");
RequestAnyInput(ColoredOutput output);
```

this is similar to how you would use `ReadKey()` from `System.Console`. it will show the message and wait for the user to break by pressing **Enter**.

```csharp
Confirm(ColoredOutput message);
Confirm(ColoredOutput message, ReadOnlySpan<string> trueValues, bool emptyIsTrue = true)
```

This is used to confirm a boolean choice from the user, such as "Save output"... it will handle the input with the message.

* The default overloads uses the values `y`, `yes` and `""` (enter key without input) as true.
* This input method ignores case for the trueValues.
