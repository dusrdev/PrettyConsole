# Useful Additions

To generally aid the programmer, and make the usage simpler, it is recommended to use:

```csharp
using static PrettyConsole.Console
```

Which will give you access to all the features with writing the namespace, however, this also means that using some functions from `System.Console` will produce a code-base that looks conflicting. For this reason many functions from `System.Console` where also implemented here, for example `Clear` and `NewLine`. Using them will be easier, and the calls would be inlined so don't worry about performance at all.

There is also a `ClearNextLines(int)` method that does what it says, it may be a niche case to need this, but it can be very helpful when dealing with other outputs that override lines (instead of just adding), such as progress bars and more.
